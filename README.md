# Movie-Recommendation-System

🎬 Everyone loves a good movie night, right?

 But how often do we sit there scrolling endlessly, unsure what to watch next—even though we know the kind of movies we love?

As a movie fan and a machine learning enthusiast,I decided to tackle this all-too-common problem with a practical solution:



📌 A Machine Learning-Based Movie Recommendation System 🎥

💡 The idea came from a simple observation—we humans forget. We forget what we loved, and we rarely get recommendations that truly align with our preferences.

So I built a system that:

✅ Understands what movie you watched previously

✅ Recommends new titles that match your taste

✅ Makes sure your next movie night is always on point

To ensure accessibility and ease of use, I designed a minimal and user-friendly interface using Streamlit.

Currently, the application is deployed locally, but it’s ready for further enhancement and cloud deployment if needed.



🧠 Behind the scenes, this system uses machine learning techniques for content-based filtering—matching movies based on features like genre, cast, director, and even plot similarity.

🔍 Text Preprocessing: Movie metadata like titles, overviews, genres, and keywords were cleaned and processed using stemming to reduce words to their root form.

🧮 Feature Extraction: Applied CountVectorizer to convert the processed textual data into a matrix of token counts for numerical analysis.

📏 Similarity Measurement: Used Cosine Similarity to compare the vectors of different movies and find the closest matches based on user preferences.



This combination allows the system to recommend movies that share similar content characteristics with those you’ve already enjoyed—providing truly personalized suggestions.



Whether you're a binge-watcher, a film buff, or someone who just wants better suggestions, this tool helps you skip the scroll and hit play. 🎞️
